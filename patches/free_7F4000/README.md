# Free 7F4000
This patch works similar to Kaijyuu's [Overworld Event Restore Patch](http://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=4354), but instead of giving 16 KB of free RAM at $7F0000, it gives 16 KB of free RAM at $7F4000. This memory area holds the whole Overworld Layer 2 tilemap of SMW, but by simply forcing the game to reload this data on Level -> OW transitions, it can be used as free RAM inside levels. This comes at the cost of a slightly longer transition, which in my opinion is barely even noticable. Optionally, the patch can also be configured to only reload this data when a "dirty" flag is set to a non-zero value. In that case, transitions will only be longer when the data actually needs to be reloaded.

Use freeconfig.cfg to configure the patch and enable or disable features. Refer to the comments in the file for explanations on each setting.
